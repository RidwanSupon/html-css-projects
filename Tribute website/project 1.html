                    <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
                    <p>Abdul Hamid Khan was born on 12 December 1880 to Bengali Muslim parents Haji Sharafat Ali Khan and Musammat Marijan Bibi in the village of Dhangara in Sirajganj (then part of Pabna District), Bengal Presidency. After completing studies at the local school, he studied under Mawlana Abdul Bari Chishti at his madrasa in Sirajganj.[13] In 1907, he enrolled at the Darul Uloom Deoband seminary for higher Islamic studies. His association with Mahmud Hasan Deobandi and other progressive Islamic thinkers inspired Bhashani to oppose British imperialism. After graduating from Deoband in 1909, he started his career as a teacher at the Kagmaree Primary School in Tangail.</p>
                    <h2>Political career</h2><hr>
                    <h3>British period</h3>
                    <p>In 1917, Bhashani became politically active and joined the Nationalist party led by Chittaranjan Das as an activist. Inspired by Mohammad Ali Jauhar, he joined the Indian National Congress in 1919. In 1920 he was arrested and imprisoned. After being released, he participated in the Khilafat movement. In 1921 he participated in Das's Non-Cooperation Movement against British imperialism. He suffered imprisonment for some days at that time along with his large numbers of followers. He joined the Muslim League in 1930. He was elected a MLA in Assam Legislative Assembly for the Dhubri (South) constituency in 1937 and served until 1946.[14] In April 1944 he was elected president of the Muslim League at its Barpeta session and thereafter devoted himself to the Pakistan Movement.</p>
                    <h3>Early Pakistan days</h3>
                    <p>After the establishment of India and Pakistan in 1947, following the exit of the British, Bhashani planned his anti-establishment course of action. On 23 June 1949, he founded East Pakistan Awami Muslim League.[citation needed] Bhasani was elected its president with Shamsul Huq as its General Secretary. On 24 July 1949 he organised the first meeting of Awami Muslim League at Armanitola, Dhaka, during which Yar Mohammad Khan contributed and finally established the party in Dhaka.[citation needed]


                        Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani after the foundation stone laying program for Shahid Minar (Martyrs' monument).
                        On 31 January 1952 he formed the "All Party Language Movement Committee" at the Dhaka Bar Library. He campaigned for the recognition of Bangla as a national language in Pakistan.[16] The National Democratic Front was established under his leadership on 4 December 1953. He renamed the Awami Muslim League as the Awami League by removing "Muslim" from its official name in the council session of Awami League held on 21–23 October 1953.[citation needed]
                        
                        The Muslim League Government both in the centre and in the province of East Pakistan lost considerable popularity after the Language Movement of 1952. It was seen as not being capable or interested in protecting the interests of East Pakistan. With an election to be held in the province in 1954, a new political party emerged to challenge the Muslim League. It was called the United Front and comprised the party led by Bhashani and the Krishak Sramik Party led by A. K. Fazlul Huq, former Prime Minister of Bengal. The Awami League, under Shahid Suhrawardy also joined the alliance. The United Front won the provincial election in East Pakistan by defeating the Muslim League.[17]
                        
                        In May 1954 Bhashani went to Stockholm. He was barred from returning to East Pakistan by the government of Iskander Mirza and branded a communist.[18] Between 7 and 23 May 1956, Bhashani went on a hunger strike to demand food for famine affected people.
                        
                        During the Kagmaree Conference of Awami League held on 7–8 February 1957, Bhashani left the West Pakistani authority which had acted negatively against East Pakistan.[19] On 24–25 July 1957, Bhashani convened the conference of All Pakistan Democratic Activists. On 25 July he formed the East Pakistan National Awami Party (NAP). Bhashani was elected the President with Mahmudul Huq Osmani, as General Secretary.
                        
                        According to Ehtisham, Bhashani played a crucial role in the opposition decision to nominate Fatima Jinnah as a candidate in the 1965 Pakistani presidential election, instead of Azam Khan. Fatima Jinnah was initially scornful of an opposition attempt to nominate her, however on Bhashani's personal intervention, she agreed to be their joint candidate.[20]
                        
                        Despite this pledged support for Fatima Jinnah, Bhashani was controversially alleged to have become inactive during the Opposition's Presidential campaign ostensibly because of Ayub Khan's pro-China leanings; Sherbaz Khan Mazari later alleged that Bhashani was bribed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.[21]
                        
                        In 1969 Bhashani launched a movement for the withdrawal of the Agartala Conspiracy Case and the release of Sheikh Mujib.[citation needed] American journalist Dan Coggin, writing for Time, credited Bhashani, "as much as any one man", for instigating the 1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan that culminated in the collapse of the Ayub Khan regime.[10] In 1970 Bhashani called for the independence of East Pakistan consistent with the 1940 Lahore Resolution.[22]
                        
                        Bhashani, with his National Awami party, had organised an International Kisan conference from 23 to 25 March 1970 in Toba Tek Singh District. During the conference he asked the Government of Pakistan to hold a referendum asking the population if they wanted Islamic Socialism. He warned that there might be guerrilla warfare if the military government failed to do so.</p>
                    <h2>War of Independence 1971</h2><hr>
                    <p>Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani was the Chairman of Sorbodoliyo Songram Parisad in 1971. Bhashani asked China to aid Bangladesh in its liberation war. His request was not answered by China.</p>
                    <h2>Career in independent Bangladesh</h2><hr>
                    <p>Following independence, Bhashani wanted to play the role of a responsible opposition.[citation needed] The progressive forces quickly gathered around him and strengthened the NAP with Kazi Zafar Ahmed as its General Secretary. But soon factional differences among the progressive forces emerged and weakened Bhashani's position.[citation needed]

                        Bhashani was highly critical of the oppressive style of the Awami League and BAKSAL government.[24] He also warned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman against his move towards a one party state and declaring himself as lifelong president. Bhashani was deeply shocked at the killing of Mujib, for whom he had a lot of fatherly affection, and his family members. The person who conveyed the news of Mujib's demise described how Bhashani cried and then went to his prayer room to offer prayer.
                        
                        In May 1976 he led a massive Long March demanding demolition of the Farakka Barrage constructed by India to divert the flow of the Ganges waters inside its territory, triggering the drying up of river Padma and desertification of Bangladesh.[25] [26]
                        
                        At the time, the government of Bangladesh unofficially supported Bhashani's Farakka Long March. Navy Chief Rear Admiral M. H. Khan was in charge of providing logistics.[citation needed] Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life from all over the country gathered in Rajshahi to participate in the Long March.[citation needed]
                        
                        On the morning of 16 March 1976, Bhashani addressed a gathering of people at the Madrash Maidan in Rajshahi, from where the Long March commenced.[citation needed] Hundreds of thousands of people walked more than 100 kilometres on foot for days. The March continued to Kansat, a place near the India-Bangladesh border, close to the Farakka barrage.[citation needed]
                        
                        Bhashani's Farakka Long March was the first popular movement against India by Bangladeshi people who demanded a rightful distribution of the Ganges' water.[27] Since then the Farakka Long March Day has been observed on 16 March every year in Bangladesh.
                        
                        Political philosophy
                        In the early 1950s he felt that an integrated Pakistan was no longer maintainable due to the hegemony of West Pakistan. At the Kagmari Conference, he bade farewell to West Pakistan by saying Assalamu Alaikum which soon became a reference quote.[19] He declined to participate in the national election of 1970 saying that it would only help perpetuate rule by West Pakistan. From 1969 his favourite slogans were Swadhin Bangla Zindabad and Azad Bangla Zindabad. His dream of an independent Purba Bangla (East Bengal) came true when Bangladesh was established as an independent nation-state in 1971. He advocated for the separation of State and religion. He was a pious Muslim who was in favour of socialism. He spoke out against Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its politics.[28]
                        
                        Journalism
                        The Daily Ittefaq has been the most popular Bengali newspaper of Bangladesh since the early 1970s. However, its precursor was the Weekly Ittefaq. After the British left South Asia in 1947, the Muslim League emerged as the governing political party. Soon opposition movements started and a political party named Awami Muslim League was founded with Bhashani as one of the central figures. Against this backdrop Bhashani and Yar Mohammad Khan started publishing the Weekly Ittefaq in 1949. The popular weekly publication was a critique of the Muslim League government.[29] The journalist Tofazzal Hossain Manik Miah worked as its editor. Manik Miah took over the paper as its editor and publisher from 14 August 1951.[30]
                        
                        On 25 February 1972, Bhashani started publishing a weekly Haq Katha and it soon achieved wide circulation. It was outspoken about the irregularities and misrule of Awami League government established after independence of Bangladesh.[citation needed] It was a pro-Chinese and socialist weekly.[31] It was edited by Irfanul Bari, Bhashani's subordinate. The weekly was subsequently banned by Sheikh Mujib.[citation needed]</p>
                    <h2>Death</h2><hr>
                    <p>Bhashani died on 17 November 1976 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, aged 96, and was buried at Santosh, Tangail.</p>
                    <h2>Legacy</h2><hr>
                    <p>Bhashani is regarded as the proponent of anti-imperialist, non-communal and left-leaning politics by his admirers in present-day Bangladesh and beyond.[33][34] In 2013, the Awami League Government of Bangladesh reduced his presence in school curricula.[35] In 2004, Bhashani was ranked number 8 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.</p>
